# restcol

Restcol is a restful doc storage for collaboration, backed by any kind of storage, the data logic contains collections (placeholder for a set of documents with its API doc) and documents.
 - collections can gather documents with similar schema together of an application, so we can detect the schema change over time. The schema for the document does not need to be defined beforehand, the schema will be created or modified according to each document request.
 - documents are placeholder for client's data in JSON/CSV/XML or even for media data. Each document key can be a predefined string or a UUID generated by the backend service.
